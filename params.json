The newer IOIO-OTG (\"on the go\") boards work with both Android devices and PC's (details [here](http://ytai-mer.blogspot.com/2012/05/second-generation-of-ioio-is-in-works.html)).\r\nThe IOIO board can be connected to its host over USB or Bluetooth, and provides a high-level Java API on the host side for using its I/O functions as if they were an integral part of the client.\r\n\r\nYou can purchase a IOIO-OTG board online from [Sparkfun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11343). Other versions can be purchased from [Jaycon Systems](http://www.jayconsystems.com/product_detail.php?prod_id=113), [IOIOMint version from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/885) or the [Droidalyzer IOIO board](http://droidalyzer.com/tech.html) from [SeeedStudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/droidalyzer-portable-android-development-kit-ioio-alcohol-detector-accessory-for-android-p-1221.html?cPath=138). Droidalyzer IOIO and IOIOMint have some additional features such as onboard LiPO, header pins and laser cut mint tin case.\r\n\r\nYou can get answers to questions and get news about IOIO on the [ioio-users discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ioio-users).\r\n\r\nThe [IOIO Gallery](http://pinterest.com/ytaibt/ioio/) lists various IOIO projects to give you some ideas of what you can do with IOIO.\r\n\r\nAnd this is [the blog of Ytai](http://ytai-mer.blogspot.com), the inventor of IOIO, where new developments are normally announced. Specifically, [this introductory post](http://ytai-mer.blogspot.com/2011/04/meet-ioio-io-for-android.html) provides a good overview of this technology.\r\n\r\n## User Documentation\r\n\r\n### Starters\r\n- [[Read This Before Connecting|Read-This-Before-Connecting]] - a really short must-read for the impatient **to avoid damaging the board**.\r\n- [[IOIO Beginner's Guide|IOIO-Beginner's-Guide]] - a \"getting started\" step-by-step tutorial for building your first IOIO application.\r\n- [[Eclipse Troubleshooting|Eclipse Troubleshooting]] - problems and solutions to common Eclipse-related problems.\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n- [[Getting to Know the IOIO-OTG Board|Getting-To-Know-The-IOIO-OTG-Board]] - information about the IOIO-OTG board and the I/O pins.\r\n- [[Getting To Know The IOIO V1 Board|Getting-To-Know-The Board]] - information about the IOIO board and the I/O pins.\r\n- [[Power Supply (IOIO-OTG)|Power-Supply-OTG]] - how to power the IOIO-OTG board, power considerations.\r\n- [[Power Supply (IOIO V1)|Power-Supply]] - how to power the IOIO V1 board, power considerations.\r\n\r\n### Connectivity\r\n\r\n**Android:**\r\n- [[IOIO Over ADB|IOIO-Over-ADB]]\r\n- [[IOIO Over Bluetooth for Android|IOIO-Over-Bluetooth]]\r\n- [[IOIO Over OpenAccessory|IOIO-Over-OpenAccessory]]\r\n\r\n**PC:**\r\n- [[Using IOIO With a PC|Using-IOIO-With-a-PC]]\r\n- [[IOIO Over Bluetooth for PC|IOIO-Over-Bluetooth-for-PC]]\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n- [[IOIOLib Basics|IOIOLib-Basics]] - overview of IOIOLib.\r\n- [[IOIOLib Core API|IOIOLib-Core-API]] - introduction to the `IOIO` interface.\r\n- [[IOIOLib Application Framework|IOIOLib-Application-Framework]] - an important set of utilities that simplify IOIO-based application authoring.\r\n- [[Digital I/O|Digital-IO]] - get those 0's and 1's in and out.\r\n- [[Analog Input|Analog-Input]] - measure voltage.\r\n- [[PWM Output|PWM-Output]] - generate pulse width modulation signals.\r\n- [[Pulse Input|Pulse-Input]] - measure pulse width and frequency.\r\n- [[UART|UART]] - communicate with serial devices.\r\n- [[SPI|SPI]] - control SPI devices as a host.\r\n- [[TWI|TWI]] - control IÂ²C and SMBus devices as a host.\r\n- [[Capacitive Sensing|Capacitive-Sensing]] touch-sensing by measuring capacitance.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n- [[Downloads|Downloads]] - this page has links to download all the software and firmware you'll need for development.\r\n- [[Release Notes|Release-Notes]] - change log of the various versions of the software and firmware.\r\n- [[Supported Devices|Supported-Devices]] - a list of all tested devices. \r\n- [[Supported Bluetooth Dongles|Supported-Bluetooth-Dongles]] - a list of all tested bluetooth dongles. \r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- [[IOIO-OTG Bootloader and IOIODude|IOIO-OTG-Bootloader-and-IOIODude]] - a guide on using the IOIODude application that lets you upgrade the firmware on your IOIO-OTG board.\r\n- [[The IOIO Manager Application|The-IOIO-Manager-Application]] - a guide on using the Android application that lets you upgrade the firmware on your IOIO v1 board.\r\n- [[IOIO Bridge|IOIO-Bridge]] - use IOIO with the Android emulator or with a target Android being debugged.\r\n\r\n## Developer Documentation\r\n*Most users shouldn't care about this section.
